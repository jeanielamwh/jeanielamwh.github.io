(First blog post, I want to learn to write and think. My ADHD med ran out mid-way so this is a bit incoherent.)

I recently had the chance to prepare for a proper system design interview for the first time in my life. Looking back I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a healthy exercise regardless of whether you‚Äôre gearing up for an interview or not.

## The obvious: You learn a lot about tech
Unless you have many years of experience in the industry, you‚Äôre unlikely to work across all areas of system design. By working through the problems you learn about your knowledge gaps in many areas.

Some interview guides online are surprisingly good material to quickly get you up to speed on common technologies and design patterns. Compared to many tech blog posts and conference presentations I find some interview guides more digestible because
* Right level of breadth vs depth: The guides are designed to cover all essential and fundamental concepts to an adequate level, whereas a blog post / presentation often targets a very specific issues
* No hidden agenda: the guides are not promoting a tech product/company, there‚Äôs no sugar coating of benchmarks to prove something. You can usually take the guides at face-value

I read through almost every article of [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/) and really enjoyed them. Though it soon occurred to me‚Ä¶

## The not so obvious: You realize you can‚Äôt fake system design experience
Compare preparing for system design with grinding LeetCode: every coding question you solve is a real experience. You have to think through the problem yourself, you have to get your hands dirty and code up the solution yourself. You have to witness your solution failing again and again, bang your head against the keyboard and fix the problem yourself. This is a proper learning experience. This you can grind.

Now what do you do when you prepare for a system design interview? You hop on YouTube to watch some guides on ‚ÄúHow to Design Foo‚Äù. You read some ‚Äúback-of-envelope‚Äù calculation which felt only slightly more tangible than reading about forest fires measured in units of football fields. A ‚Äúguru‚Äù tells you a pattern X or a technology Y is ill-fitted for problem Z, you memorized it. Finally you learned to regurgitate it all through the medium of boxes and arrows. This does not count as ‚Äúreal‚Äù experience. This you can‚Äôt grind.

## If I had a year to prepare for my system design interview, I would work on being a nosier dev
If I had a year to prepare for my coding interview, I would perhaps spend an hour every week to work through more problems. But if I had a year to prepare for my system design interview, my priority would not be to sit at home and revise. I truly believe being a good dev (which is ultimately what the system design interview is trying to ascertain) is wrought by sweat and blood. Sweat from building your own system and blood from witnessing it fail. Shall my own  sweat and blood be insufficient, my neighbors‚Äô will do üôÇ.

So if I had a year to prepare for my system design interview, I would spend more time bugging my sister team about their system design. They have a living and breathing real-time notification system sitting just right there! Why read about an abstract design when you can tinker with a real one?

If I had a year to prepare for my system design interview, I would spend more time nosing into the infra teams outage tickets and interview them on what woke them up at 3 a.m. to fix their system. I would invite myself to more design meetings and build a reputation as the fellow who asked too many questions.

The choices are endless. But more importantly they are infinitely more fun and rewarding then sitting at home revising. That's my biggest takeaway from the system design prep.
